# SAV_mapping
Instructions and code for mapping submerged aquatic vegetation from Planet satellite imagery.

1. Start by reading the SAV_mapping workshop pdf. This is the introduction material and workflow for the SAV mapping workshop that was held in Annapolis, MD in July 2023.

2. Accessing Planet satellite imagery. If you already have a planet account you can skip this step.

   **Option A**: Sign up for an Education and Research Account (5,000 km^2/month) at https://www.planet.com/markets/education-and-research/ . The online form is easy, they do not need very much information.  The account is    for 1 year with renewal. This can take about 2 weeks.

   **Option B**: Longer term if you are funded by a US federal agency you can apply for access via CSDA, this gives you a larger allocation compared to the E&R account. You are allowed to have both this and an E&R account.    https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/csda/commercial-datasets.
